# Task 01 - stat

Write your stat.
Type the **stat** *file name* in the terminal and see what it outputs.
Write a program that will do the same. 
On the command line, you need to type man 2 lstat and enjoy reading, as well as almost the code written for you in this very man. Also, to complete the task, you need to understand
how the following commands differ: **lstat**, **statx**, **fstat**, **fstatat**.

Usage:
```
01_stat.exe <pathname>
```
